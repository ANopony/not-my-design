**"The coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human activity can be conceived and rationally understood only as *revolutionizing practice*."**  
— Karl Marx, *Theses on Feuerbach* (1845)

In 1971, as Florida's Walt Disney World neared completion, designer **Welton Becket** faced an unexpected challenge: how to design pathways between attractions. Traditional blueprints felt arbitrary—how could anyone dictate where people *should* walk without observing where they *naturally chose* to walk?  

Becket launched a radical experiment. Instead of paving predetermined routes, his team sowed grass seeds across the empty fields between rides and landmarks. When the park soft-opened, visitors wandered freely—their footsteps tracing desire lines toward castles, rollercoasters, and restrooms. Over months, thousands of footsteps carved organic trails into the earth: wide arteries leading to popular rides, slender shortcuts to quiet spots.  

Becket ordered workers to pave precisely where the grass lay worn. The resulting paths felt magically intuitive—flowing like natural extensions of human movement, reducing congestion, and embracing landscapes. Visitors marveled at how the walkways seemed to "remember" their needs.  

This design was awarded the 1971 World Design Award, with Becket humbly admitting: "Actually, that was **not my design** — it was the people's." The jury celebrated its revolutionary philosophy: **truth emerges from collective practice**. These paths weren’t drawn on paper but *forged by footsteps*.
